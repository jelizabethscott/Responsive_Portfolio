      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
      <p>I am a Front-End Web Developer with a background in graphic design. Specializing in UI/UX design and functionality using technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery. Also being exposed to such technologies as Node.js, MySQL, Sequelize, Angular, MongoDB, and  React; I will be able to quickly attain  and implement knowledge gained. Coming from a background in hospitality and retail this was indeed a big transition but I often use some of the same skills: leadership, time management, teamwork, and the drive to accomplish the tasks that are at hand. Enrolling and being accepted into Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp and being exposed to these new technologies and languages in brief period of time has changed how I view the world around me. I have developed a true appreciation and passion for the world of coding.
